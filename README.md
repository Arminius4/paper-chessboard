# paper-chessboard
A chess board that can be printed on paper. It is optimized for size and production convenience, i.e. it has the largest field size to be easily printed on only 4 A4 paper sheets.

The field size is 50mm.

## Instructions

Print 4 times and cut off the brown border as appropiate (at two adjacent edges each). When printing on A4, there will be a printing margin of approximately the size of the brown border.

For the two-coloured board, there is also another file with only two brown edges for a board where individual sheets are meant to overlap. Print two of file 2 and two of file 1 for that.

## Customization

You can get a smaller size by simply printing it smaller (printer setting) or scaling using the GIMP files (.xcf).

If you want different colours open the GIMP files (.xcf), select the wanted colours from the colour palette and use the filling tool (Shift+B) and click on the tiles to colour them.
